osdkeys
=====

Show keys pressed with an on-screen display. Very useful for
screencasts. Works with XMonad. Linux only.

This program uses the `xinput` program to get a stream of key presses
and uses the `libnotify` library to display them on-screen.

Currently supported display notations are: Emacs

## Why not screenkey?

That has unpredictable key grabbing, doesn't support XMonad and is
unmaintained.
